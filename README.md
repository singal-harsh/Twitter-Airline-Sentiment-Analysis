# Twitter-Airline-Sentiment-Analysis

Here we will analyze the dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment), originally posted by Crowdflower, which includes 14,640 tweets about 6 major US airlines posted in February 2015. These tweets are the passenger comments after their flight with different airline companies. I have used Deep Neaural Nets to Classify the Sentiment of the user into Postive, Negtive and Neutral.
